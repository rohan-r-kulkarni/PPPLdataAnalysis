# PPPLdataAnalysis

Data Analysis work at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory.

Analyzing solar drift waves as a candidate source for magenetic reconnection, which can have harmful implications for human telecommunications and satellites.

Analyzed time-series data from NASA solar missions, calculating 2-3x harmful radiation from magnetic/electric fields.
Utilized data modeling/visualization in Python (SciPy, NumPy, Matplotlib) to identify and interpret patterns in space. 
Hypothesized data-driven R&D solutions for protecting 5K+ telecom satellites; presented at American Physical Society.
